**Author**: Murad Shurman & Yousef Salem
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. We Built out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted us, and what's recommended to read next.
This repo contains our front-end work.


## Architecture


This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript React. Mongo was used to create our NoSQL database, and was manipulated by using mongoose. Auth0 was used to give users authentication and autherization. The libraris were used during this project:  axios, react-bootstrap, dotenv, mongoose, express, and cors.

## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

during lab time (1:20pm - 5:00pm) & (9:00pm-11:00pm).

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

We used Remo as communication platform.

- How often will you take breaks?

most likely will be after 5:00pm till 9:00pm.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Work in our break time.

### Cooperative


- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

Yousef :  Back-end
Murad : Front-end

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Make comments on each other's work, and try to work on our weak points.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Yousef :  I want to develop greater strength at Front-end
Murad : I want to develop greater strength at Back-end

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

At the start of each day we review our previous code together, then plan on what to do next to make sure we are on the same page.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

Advice them and give them specific work to do in order to make sure they work same weight as others.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Making sure at the start of each day we divide work equally between team members, by that we prevent that from happening.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

By reviewing previous code at start of each day to make sure that everyone understands everything we did.
